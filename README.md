# plan

my profile -> all my albums -> all user (urls) that have any of my albums -> all their albums

so I actually build users first and for a user: add album if not there yet + add edge

next: 
* query by tags
* add tags to albums

jill install --preferred-arch arm64
ENV["PYTHON"]="python3"
]instantiate
]build PyCall   - if still not working
